# Summary

This is a signaling proposal to include the GLTO/OSMO (#778) liquidity pool in the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives.

Gelotto has contributed 23,663,812 GLTO to be distributed as external incentives for the GLTO/OSMO (#778) pool over a period of 180 days.

Gelotto has also contributed 150 GKEY (a rare secondary asset with a maximum supply of 1000 used in Gelotto’s annual Grand Prize game) to be distributed as external incentives for the GLTO/OSMO (#778) pool over a period of 180 days.

# About Gelotto (GLTO)

GLTO is the native token of the Gelotto platform (expected launch Q3 2022).  Gelotto is a luck-based gaming platform that will initially offer lottery games for various IBC assets including ATOM, OSMO, JUNO, SCRT, STARS, GLTO, and others. Future expansions for the platform will include the addition of other games of chance, such as blackjack and slots.

In addition to offering lotteries for IBC assets that recur on various timeframes (such as hourly, daily, or weekly), Gelotto intends to offer a weekly “mega-jackpot” for which tickets are earned by completing weekly “missions” by participating in a selection of games on the platform.

Annually, Gelotto intends to host a “Grand Prize” event that includes numerous lucrative prizes (target value of 50,000 USD per prize), with a grand prize of 10-100 BTC. Every month, holders of at least a certain amount of GLTO will receive a small amount of Gelotto’s rare secondary GKEY asset, which is used to “unlock” prizes in the Grand Prize event. GKEY is also being distributed as external incentives for the GLTO/OSMO (#778) pool. GKEY may be separately traded and have its own value.

In addition to using the GLTO token to play games on the Gelotto platform, the GLTO token will be usable to purchase NFTs (Gelotto has partnered with an experienced NFT producer for this purpose), which will feature gaming and Gelotto-themed artwork and may offer special bonuses to certain games on the platform.

GLTO has a fixed supply and does not use traditional inflationary staking methods.  In place of inflationary staking methods, once blackjack and slots have been added to the platform, Gelotto will provide the opportunity to “stake” GLTO to act as “the house” in these games. When players win against the house, winnings will be paid using the staked GLTO. When players lose a game, the losses will be added to the staked tokens and distributed to the stakers. Because the odds in these games of chance favor the house, staking in this manner is statistically expected to generate profit, but in a fun, gambling-based, manner with variable returns based on the number of games played and the outcomes of those games.

The GLTO token was recently airdropped to stakers of ATOM, OSMO, JUNO, STARS, and SCRT. 60% of the GLTO token supply is slated to be distributed via airdrop. 15% is slated to be distributed as incentives to liquidity providers. 15% is slated to be distributed as prizes and incentives on the Gelotto platform. 10% will be released to the development team over a period of three years.

Ample liquidity for the GLTO token is important to ensure its availability to participants on the platform. When the Gelotto platform launches, and especially as new games are added, there will be a substantial need to swap between GLTO and other IBC assets with minimal slippage. Offering OSMO incentives to liquidity providers for the GLTO/OSMO (#778) liquidity pool will help to ensure sufficient liquidity, and will generate transactional fees for Osmosis and for the liquidity providers.

Gelotto has already contributed 23,663,812 GLTO and 150 GKEY to be distributed as external incentives for the GLTO/OSMO (#778) pool over a period of 180 days. A testnet version of the Gelotto platform is expected to launch this month (August 2022). The Gelotto development team is very invested in this project, with “skin in the game”, and intends for the GLTO/OSMO pool to remain a longstanding feature of Osmosis.
